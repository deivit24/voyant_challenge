# Voyant Challenge

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap Library, and React.js

it probably took me a little over 4 hrs to complete. I started Friday night worked on the functionality. The finished it on Saturday night

I would love to go over this project to explain my methodology and reasons behind certain decisions I made.

Thank you for your time!
